                    &nbsp Hi! I'm Sammy, the crochter behind Sammy's Crochet Crafts! 
                    It all began back in 2019 when I saw a video of a crochet cow- I knew I had to make one.
                    Through trial and error (and lots of YouTube), I progressed as a crocheter and in July of 2022 I decided to open an Etsy shop.
                    Ever since then I've continued to use Etsy and have attended handfuls of craft markets.
                    I truly love creating each and every one of my plushies/patterns and I'm so grateful to have my own small business.
                    Thank you all so much for your support and love! â™¡
                </p>

            <div id="faq-questions">
                <div class="question"><p>How did you learn to crochet?</p></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p> My mom is the one that first taught me crochet and my first project was a simlpe hotpad.
                        Once I had the basic stitches down, I moved on to amigurumi because I wanted to learn how to crochet a cow!
                        I dove deep into YouTube and through lots of practice, I found myself obssessed with creating crochet animals.
                        That is when I learned how to use plush yarn and continued the cycle of trial and error to find myself where I am today!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question"><p>What materials do you use for your plushies?</p></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>My smaller plushies use the yarn Adore-A-Ball and Velvety Smooth by Yarn Bee from Hobby Lobby.
                        I'll also sometimes use Parfait Chunky by Premier yarns!
                        For my larger plushies I like Sweet Snuggles or Chenille by Loops & Threads from Michaels.
                        I get my safety eyes and stuffing all off of Amazon!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question"><p>Do you offer custom orders?</p></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>I currently do not offer complete custom orders. 
                        However, for many of my plushies there is customizable features, such as choosing specfic colors.
                        Although not completely custom, there is much personalization with many of my crochet creations!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question"><p>How should I care for my crochet items?</p></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The way I reccommend is spot cleaning. 
                        This is done by using water and a small cloth. 
                        Gently scrub the spot that needs attention.
                        Make sure to dry the area properly by press a dry towel against the spot.
                        Whatever you do, do not put your plushie in a washer or submerge in water because of the damage it can cause!
                        The stuffing will absorb the water which can lead to mold, the shape can get distorted, and the colors may even bleed.
                        For more details, there are many instructions available online!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question"><p>Are your products safe for babaies and children?</p></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>For the most part, yes. These plushies are safest for children over the age of 3.
                        There is a choking hazard with the plastic safety eyes. 
                        Please supervise young children or those at risk.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question" id="qa6"><p>What are your estimated delivery times?</p></div>
                <div class="answer" id="qa6">
                    <p> Delievery times can vary based on size and location. 
                        For the most part, my plushies are created and sent out 2-4 weeks after an order is placed.
                        This length is due to the fact I'm a full-time student, specific yarn availability, and time required!
                        I try to get your order out as soon as possible!
                        From there, the delivery itself can take anywhere from 3-12 days based on location.
